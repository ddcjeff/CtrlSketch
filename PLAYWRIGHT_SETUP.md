# Playwright End-to-End Testing Setup

## Overview

We've successfully implemented Playwright for end-to-end testing of the CtrlSketch_Hybrid application. This setup allows us to test the application in real browsers, ensuring that it works correctly from a user's perspective.

## What's Been Implemented

### 1. Playwright Installation and Configuration

- Installed Playwright and its browser dependencies
- Created a configuration file (`playwright.config.js`) with settings for:
  - Multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
  - Screenshot capture on test failure
  - HTML reporting
  - Automatic web server startup

### 2. Test Scripts

Created initial end-to-end tests for:

- **Basic Application Functionality**:
  - Application loading
  - Ribbon tab navigation
  - Layer panel toggling

- **Drawing Functionality**:
  - Tool selection
  - Shape drawing on canvas

- **Layer Management**:
  - Layer visibility toggling
  - Layer opacity adjustment

### 3. CI/CD Integration

- Updated GitHub Actions workflow to run both unit tests and end-to-end tests
- Added artifact storage for test reports and results

### 4. Documentation

- Created comprehensive documentation for using Playwright
- Added npm scripts for running tests with different options

## How to Use

### Running Tests Locally

1. **Run all tests**:
   ```bash
   npm run test:e2e
   ```

2. **Run tests with UI mode** (for interactive debugging):
   ```bash
   npm run test:e2e:ui
   ```

3. **View test reports**:
   ```bash
   npm run test:e2e:report
   ```

### Writing New Tests

1. Create a new file in the `tests/e2e` directory with a `.spec.js` extension
2. Follow the patterns in the existing test files
3. Run the tests to verify they work as expected

## Benefits

1. **Cross-Browser Testing**: Tests run in Chrome, Firefox, and Safari
2. **Visual Verification**: Screenshots capture visual state for verification
3. **Comprehensive Testing**: Tests the application as users would experience it
4. **CI Integration**: Automated testing on every code change
5. **Debugging Tools**: UI mode and trace viewer for easy debugging

## Next Steps

1. **Expand Test Coverage**:
   - Add tests for more complex user interactions
   - Test edge cases and error handling

2. **Visual Regression Testing**:
   - Implement screenshot comparison for detecting visual changes

3. **Performance Testing**:
   - Add tests for measuring application performance

4. **Test Organization**:
   - Implement page object pattern for more maintainable tests

## Conclusion

The Playwright setup provides a solid foundation for end-to-end testing of the CtrlSketch_Hybrid application. By continuing to expand test coverage and leveraging Playwright's powerful features, we can ensure the application works correctly across different browsers and for all user interactions.
