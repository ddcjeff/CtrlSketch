# CtrlSketch Pro User Manual - Line Style Options

## Overview

CtrlSketch Pro offers powerful line styling capabilities that allow you to customize the appearance of your drawings. This guide explains how to use the line styling options to enhance your diagrams and schematics.

## Line Styling Features

CtrlSketch Pro provides three key line styling options:

1. **Line Thickness** - Control the width of lines from 1px to 10px
2. **Line Style** - Choose between solid, dashed, and dotted lines
3. **Arrow Style** - Select from various arrow endpoints for connections and arrows

## Accessing Line Style Options

Line style options can be accessed in two ways:

1. **From the Toolbar**: Click the "Line Styles" button in the main toolbar
2. **From the Properties Panel**: When an element is selected, look for the "Appearance" section in the properties panel

## Line Thickness

### Setting Line Thickness

1. Select an element or choose a drawing tool
2. Open the line style options
3. Use one of the preset thickness buttons (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, or 10px)
4. For precise control, use the thickness slider (1-10px)

### Tips for Line Thickness

- Use thinner lines (1-2px) for general outlines and connections
- Use medium thickness (3-5px) for emphasizing important elements
- Use thicker lines (6-10px) for highlighting critical parts of your diagram
- Maintain consistency in thickness throughout your document for a professional look

## Line Styles

### Available Line Styles

CtrlSketch Pro offers three line styles:

1. **Solid** - A continuous, unbroken line (default)
2. **Dashed** - A line made up of short dashes
3. **Dotted** - A line made up of small dots

### When to Use Different Line Styles

- **Solid Lines**: Use for permanent, physical connections or primary boundaries
- **Dashed Lines**: Ideal for indicating boundaries, hidden features, or secondary elements
- **Dotted Lines**: Perfect for showing virtual connections, potential relationships, or tertiary elements

### Changing Line Style

1. Select an element or choose a drawing tool
2. Open the line style options
3. Click on the desired line style button (solid, dashed, or dotted)
4. The selected element or new drawings will use the chosen line style

## Arrow Styles

### Available Arrow Styles

CtrlSketch Pro includes six arrow styles:

1. **None** - No arrowhead, just a straight line endpoint
2. **Simple** - A basic arrow with two lines (default)
3. **Triangle** - An outlined triangular arrowhead
4. **Filled Triangle** - A solid triangular arrowhead
5. **Diamond** - A diamond-shaped arrowhead
6. **Circle** - A circular endpoint

### When to Use Different Arrow Styles

- **None**: When no directional indication is needed
- **Simple**: For basic flowcharts and general directional indication
- **Triangle/Filled Triangle**: For strong directional emphasis in flowcharts and diagrams
- **Diamond**: Often used for decision points or to indicate a transition
- **Circle**: Commonly used for termination points or to indicate a junction

### Changing Arrow Style

1. Select an arrow element or choose the arrow/connection tool
2. Open the line style options
3. Click on the desired arrow style
4. The selected arrow or new arrows will use the chosen style

## Using Line Styles in Technical Diagrams

### For Circuit Diagrams

- Use solid lines with medium thickness for main connections
- Use dashed lines for ground connections
- Use different arrow styles to indicate signal direction
- Use consistent line thickness for similar types of connections

### For Flowcharts

- Use thicker lines for main process flow
- Use different line styles to distinguish between data flow and control flow
- Use appropriate arrow styles to clearly indicate direction and relationship types

### For Engineering Drawings

- Use solid lines for visible edges
- Use dashed lines for hidden edges
- Use different thicknesses to indicate importance or proximity
- Maintain consistent line styling for similar components

## Keyboard Shortcuts

Access line styling options faster with these keyboard shortcuts:

- **Ctrl+L** - Open line style options panel
- **Ctrl+[** - Decrease line thickness
- **Ctrl+]** - Increase line thickness
- **Ctrl+Shift+S** - Cycle through line styles (solid → dashed → dotted → solid)
- **Ctrl+Shift+A** - Cycle through arrow styles

## Tips for Professional Diagrams

1. **Consistency**: Use the same line styles for similar elements throughout your document
2. **Hierarchy**: Use line thickness to create visual hierarchy (thicker lines draw more attention)
3. **Meaning**: Assign specific meaning to different line styles in your diagrams
4. **Legend**: Consider adding a legend explaining what different line styles represent
5. **Contrast**: Ensure your line styles are clearly distinguishable, especially when printing

## Troubleshooting

### Line Styles Not Applying

If line styles are not applying to elements:

1. Ensure the element is fully selected (highlighted)
2. Try selecting a different line style and then reselecting your desired style
3. Check if the element type supports the selected line style

### Arrow Styles Not Showing

If arrow styles are not visible:

1. Verify you're working with an arrow or connection element
2. Ensure the line is long enough for the arrowhead to be visible
3. Try a different arrow style to see if the issue is style-specific
