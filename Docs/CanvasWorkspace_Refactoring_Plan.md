# CanvasWorkspace Component Refactoring Plan

## Overview
This plan outlines how to split the large CanvasWorkspace.vue file into smaller, more manageable components. The current file is too large, making it difficult to maintain and debug.

## Component Structure

### 1. Core Components

#### `CanvasWorkspace.vue` (Main Container)
- Responsible for orchestrating all sub-components
- Maintains the canvas state and core properties
- Handles high-level events and communication between components

#### `CanvasRenderer.vue`
- Handles the actual canvas drawing operations
- Manages the render loop and performance optimizations
- Contains shape rendering logic

#### `CanvasInteraction.vue`
- Manages mouse/touch interactions
- Handles pan, zoom, and selection operations
- Processes user input events

### 2. Tool-Specific Components

#### `DrawingTools.vue`
- Contains logic for all drawing tools (rectangle, circle, line, etc.)
- Manages tool state and behavior
- Handles tool-specific interactions

#### `SelectionTool.vue`
- Manages selection operations
- Handles multi-select, group selection
- Contains selection rectangle logic

#### `ShapeManipulation.vue`
- Handles resize, rotate, and transform operations
- Manages control handles and manipulation UI
- Contains shape transformation logic

### 3. Utility Components

#### `CanvasGrid.vue`
- Renders the background grid
- Handles grid snapping functionality
- Manages grid appearance and behavior

#### `CanvasDebug.vue`
- Contains all debugging functionality
- Displays performance metrics and debug info
- Manages debug overlays and tools

#### `ShapeCache.vue`
- Handles shape caching for performance
- Manages cached canvases and invalidation
- Contains optimization logic

## Data Flow Architecture

### State Management
- Use Vue's provide/inject for shared state
- Consider Pinia or Vuex for complex state management
- Maintain clear data flow between components

### Event Communication
- Define clear event interfaces between components
- Use custom events for component communication
- Maintain a consistent event naming convention

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Preparation
1. Create empty component files with basic structure
2. Set up proper imports and exports
3. Define component interfaces and props

### Phase 2: Core Extraction
1. Extract rendering logic to CanvasRenderer
2. Move interaction handling to CanvasInteraction
3. Maintain core state in CanvasWorkspace

### Phase 3: Tool Extraction
1. Extract drawing tools to DrawingTools
2. Move selection logic to SelectionTool
3. Extract manipulation functionality to ShapeManipulation

### Phase 4: Utility Extraction
1. Move grid functionality to CanvasGrid
2. Extract debugging to CanvasDebug
3. Move caching logic to ShapeCache

### Phase 5: Integration and Testing
1. Ensure all components work together
2. Test all functionality
3. Optimize performance

## File Structure

```
src/
└── components/
    └── canvas/
        ├── CanvasWorkspace.vue       # Main container
        ├── core/
        │   ├── CanvasRenderer.vue    # Rendering logic
        │   └── CanvasInteraction.vue # User interaction
        ├── tools/
        │   ├── DrawingTools.vue      # Drawing tools
        │   ├── SelectionTool.vue     # Selection functionality
        │   └── ShapeManipulation.vue # Transform operations
        └── utils/
            ├── CanvasGrid.vue        # Grid functionality
            ├── CanvasDebug.vue       # Debug features
            └── ShapeCache.vue        # Caching system
```

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Improved Maintainability**: Smaller files are easier to understand and modify
2. **Better Separation of Concerns**: Each component has a clear responsibility
3. **Enhanced Testability**: Components can be tested in isolation
4. **Easier Collaboration**: Team members can work on different components simultaneously
5. **Improved Performance**: Better opportunities for optimization
6. **Reduced Cognitive Load**: Developers can focus on one aspect at a time

## Potential Challenges

1. **State Management Complexity**: Ensuring proper state sharing between components
2. **Performance Overhead**: Potential overhead from component communication
3. **Refactoring Effort**: Significant initial effort to split the code
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Ensuring all existing functionality works

## Next Steps

1. Create the directory structure
2. Implement empty component files with interfaces
3. Begin extracting functionality from CanvasWorkspace.vue
4. Test each component as it's extracted
5. Integrate components and ensure they work together
