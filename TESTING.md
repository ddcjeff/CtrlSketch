# Testing Implementation for CtrlSketch_Hybrid

## Overview

This document outlines the testing strategy implemented for the CtrlSketch_Hybrid application. The testing framework is designed to ensure code quality, prevent regressions, and facilitate future development.

## Testing Framework

We've implemented a comprehensive testing framework using:

- **Vitest**: A fast Vite-native testing framework
- **Vue Test Utils**: The official testing library for Vue.js
- **JSDOM**: For simulating a browser environment
- **Testing Library**: For more user-centric testing approaches

## Test Types

### Unit Tests

Located in `tests/unit/`, these tests focus on testing individual components and utilities in isolation:

- **Component Tests**: Verify that components render correctly and respond to events
- **Utility Tests**: Ensure utility functions work as expected

### Integration Tests

Located in `tests/integration/`, these tests focus on how components interact with each other:

- **Component Interaction**: Test how components communicate via events
- **State Management**: Verify that state changes propagate correctly between components

## Continuous Integration

A GitHub Actions workflow has been set up to automatically run tests on:

- Push to main branches (main, master, develop)
- Pull requests to main branches

## Running Tests Locally

Tests can be run locally using the following npm scripts:

```bash
# Run all tests once
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode (useful during development)
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage report
npm run test:coverage
```

## Test Coverage

The current test suite covers:

1. **Layer Management**:
   - Layer visibility toggling
   - Layer opacity adjustment
   - Layer selection

2. **Ribbon Component**:
   - Tab switching
   - Button rendering
   - Event emission

3. **Utility Functions**:
   - Opacity conversion
   - Icon selection logic

## Future Improvements

1. **Increase Test Coverage**:
   - Add tests for remaining components
   - Add tests for complex interactions

2. **End-to-End Testing**:
   - Implement Cypress or Playwright for E2E tests
   - Create user journey tests

3. **Visual Regression Testing**:
   - Add screenshot comparison tests
   - Ensure UI consistency across changes

4. **Performance Testing**:
   - Test rendering performance
   - Test canvas operations performance

## Best Practices

1. **Write Tests First**: Consider adopting a TDD approach for new features
2. **Keep Tests Focused**: Each test should verify one specific behavior
3. **Use Descriptive Names**: Test names should clearly describe what is being tested
4. **Avoid Implementation Details**: Test behavior, not implementation
5. **Maintain Tests**: Update tests when changing code
