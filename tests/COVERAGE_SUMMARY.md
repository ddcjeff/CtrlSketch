## Coverage Improvement Plan

### Short-term Goals (1-2 weeks)

1. **Increase Core Component Coverage**:
   - Improve App.vue coverage to at least 60%
   - Improve CanvasWorkspace.vue coverage to at least 50%

2. **Add Tests for Critical Functionality**:
   - Canvas drawing operations
   - Shape manipulation
   - Layer management
   - Tool interactions

3. **Fix Existing Test Issues**:
   - Ensure all tests are reliable and not flaky
   - Improve test isolation

### Medium-term Goals (1-2 months)

1. **Reach Overall Coverage Targets**:
   - Statements: 50%
   - Branches: 75%
   - Functions: 50%
   - Lines: 50%

2. **Implement End-to-End Tests**:
   - Add Cypress or Playwright for E2E testing
   - Create tests for critical user journeys

3. **Improve Test Organization**:
   - Organize tests by feature
   - Add more integration tests

### Long-term Goals (3+ months)

1. **Comprehensive Test Suite**:
   - Statements: 75%+
   - Branches: 85%+
   - Functions: 75%+
   - Lines: 75%+

2. **Automated Visual Regression Testing**:
   - Implement screenshot comparison tests
   - Ensure UI consistency

3. **Performance Testing**:
   - Add tests for rendering performance
   - Test canvas operations with large numbers of shapes

## Priority Components for Testing

Based on the coverage report, these components should be prioritized for additional tests:

1. **CanvasWorkspace.vue** (9.1% coverage)
   - Core drawing functionality
   - Shape manipulation
   - Event handling

2. **App.vue** (37.26% coverage)
   - Application state management
   - Component integration
   - Event coordination

3. **ToolFlyout.vue** (50% coverage)
   - Tool selection
   - UI interactions

## Recommendations

1. **Adopt Test-Driven Development (TDD)** for new features
2. **Add tests when fixing bugs** to prevent regressions
3. **Focus on critical user paths** rather than trying to achieve 100% coverage everywhere
4. **Regularly run coverage reports** to track progress
5. **Integrate testing into the development workflow** with pre-commit hooks
