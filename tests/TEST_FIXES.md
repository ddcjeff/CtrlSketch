# Test Fixes Summary

This document outlines the changes made to fix the failing tests in the CtrlSketch_Hybrid application.

## Layers Component Tests

### Issues Fixed:

1. **Missing `visible` prop**: 
   - The Layers component requires a `visible` prop to render, which was missing in the test setup.
   - Added the `visible: true` prop to the test mount configuration.

2. **Incorrect CSS selectors**: 
   - Updated selectors to match the actual component structure:
     - Changed `.visibility-toggle` to `.layer-controls button:first-child`
     - Changed `.opacity-toggle` to `.layer-controls button:nth-child(3)`

3. **Event emission changes**: 
   - The component now emits `update-layers` instead of `update-layer-visibility`
   - Updated tests to check for the correct event and payload structure

## Ribbon Component Tests

### Issues Fixed:

1. **Case sensitivity in text assertions**: 
   - Changed expected text from uppercase to match the actual component text:
     - Changed `'CLIPBOARD'` to `'Clipboard'`
     - Changed `'VIEW'` to `'View'`

2. **Button selection**: 
   - Improved the way buttons are selected in tests to be more robust

## Integration Tests

### Issues Fixed:

1. **Event emission changes**: 
   - Updated the layer visibility test to use `update-layers` event instead of `update-layer-visibility`
   - Created a proper updated layers array to simulate the event payload

## General Improvements:

1. **More descriptive test assertions**: 
   - Added comments to clarify what each test is checking
   - Improved the structure of assertions to be more readable

2. **Better test isolation**: 
   - Ensured each test properly sets up its own state
   - Avoided test interdependencies

## Next Steps:

1. **Increase test coverage**: 
   - Add tests for more components
   - Add tests for edge cases

2. **Improve test documentation**: 
   - Add more comments to explain complex test scenarios
   - Document test patterns for future test development

3. **Set up continuous integration**: 
   - Configure GitHub Actions to run tests automatically
   - Add test coverage reporting
